🔹 STEP 2.5.1 — Create the frontend folder (safe)
Go to your project root (where docker-compose.yml is):

cd ~/project
mkdir frontend
cd frontend

🔹 STEP 2.5.2 — Create the React app (base)

We will use Create React App (safe, standard, accepted in PAP).

Run:

npx create-react-app loadwise-dashboard


This will take a few minutes.

When it finishes, you should have:

frontend/
└── loadwise-dashboard/
    ├── src/
    ├── public/
    ├── package.json


✔ This is now part of your PAP
✔ Still nothing Docker-related yet
✔ Backend is untouched

🔹 STEP 2.5.3 — Adapt the structure to YOUR planned one

Now we reshape it to match what you planned originally.

Go inside src:
cd loadwise-dashboard/src

Create folders:
mkdir components pages

Create files:
touch api.js
touch App.jsx


Now your structure is:

src/
├── components/
├── pages/
├── api.js
├── App.jsx
└── index.js


✔ Matches your original design
✔ Clean
✔ Professional

🔹 STEP 2.5.4 — First connection to your backend (IMPORTANT)

We now make React talk to your existing load balancer.

Edit api.js:

nano api.js

Paste into api.js (api.js)

✔ Calls NGINX
✔ Gets Service A or B
✔ Measures latency
✔ Perfect for PAP metrics

Save and exit.

🔹 STEP 2.5.5 — Create the Dashboard page

Create pages/Dashboard.jsx

nano pages/Dashboard.jsx

Paste into Dashboard.jsx (Dashboard.jsx)

✔ Shows Service A / B switching
✔ Shows latency
✔ Auto-refresh
✔ Very strong PAP evidence

🔹 STEP 2.5.6 — Connect Dashboard to App

Edit App.jsx

nano App.jsx

🔹 STEP 2.5.7 — Update index.js (small change)

Open:

nano index.js

Replace:

import App from './App';

With:

import App from './App.jsx';

Save.

🔹 STEP 2.5.8 — Test React locally (before Docker)

Go back to the frontend root:

cd ..
npm start

Open browser on the VM (or via SSH port forward):

http://localhost:3000

You should see:

“LoadWise Dashboard”

Response alternating between Service A and Service B

Latency changing every 2 seconds

🎉 THIS MEANS STEP 2.5 IS WORKING FUNCTIONALLY

🟢 STOP HERE (IMPORTANT)

Do NOT Dockerize yet.
Do NOT modify docker-compose yet.

We always:

make it work

then containerize

✅ STATUS CHECKPOINT

Tell me:

1️⃣ Did npm start work?
2️⃣ Do you see Service A / B alternating in the UI?

Reply with:

YES / NO

and paste any error if there is one

Then we continue with Dockerizing React (Step 2.5.9).
